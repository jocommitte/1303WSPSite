				<h1>Site Intent</h1>
				<p>The reason for the redesign of Big State Pharmacy is to generate a better User Experience.  My main goal is to convert the markup to valid HTML5 and CSS3 so the search engines will have a better chance of indexing the site.  All errors of the site will be removed and good semantic code will be instantiated.</p>
				<p>User interface elements such as the navigation, will be redesigned and provide a sleek design, more agreeable with todays web 2.0 standards.  Big State Drugs has three different sections in their store.  They have a pharmacy, soda fountain and grill.  I will add pages that support this, allowing the user to have a better understanding of what they are getting when they invest their time into Big State Drugs</p>
				<p>Big State has quality reviews listed on <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-state-drug-irving">yelp.com</a>.  These reviews will be integrated into the site to allow users to see the kind of quality services they provide.  Most of their competition is single minded, meaning they are only a drug store or only a diner.  People need to know the benefits of a "mom and pop" store.</p>

				<h1>Competition Analysis</h1>
				<p>Big State Drugs is one of the only "mom and pop" stores left.  That being the case their competition is high, while being low at the same time.  The top pharmacies that come up on Alexa.com are cvs.com, kroger.com, and walgreens.com.  The restaurants that come up on alexa.com are sonicdrivein.com, jackinthebox.com and restaurantica.com.  Big State Drugs does not come up in any of the searches.  The lack of keywords is a problem that will be fixed with the redesign. Big State Drugs is not indexed on Alexa so there is no information regarding their keywords or analytics.  The first step will be getting Big State Drugs noticed within the world wide web.</p>
